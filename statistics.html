                      The violation is common in Ward 44 because it is a
                      residential area that experiences heavy traffic due to the
                      presence of Wrigley Field stadium. This creates limited
                      parking availability, causing residents to park their
                      vehicles on the street for longer periods, leading to an
                      increased likelihood of receiving a parking ticket for
                      expired plates or temporary registration.

                    Street cleaning violation occurs when a vehicle is parked on
                    a street during the scheduled street cleaning hours. In most
                    cities, streets are cleaned on a regular schedule, and signs
                    are posted on the streets indicating the time and date of
                    street cleaning. If a parked vehicle obstructs the street
                    cleaning process, it may receive a parking ticket.

                  <p class="font-weight-medium m-0">
                    This violation is common in Ward 44 because the ward has
                    designated street cleaning days where parking is prohibited
                    on certain streets for a period of time to allow for street
                    cleaning. Additionally, the ward is a densely populated area
                    with limited parking availability, which can make finding
                    alternative parking options during street cleaning hours
                    difficult for motorists.

                    This violation refers to parking or standing a vehicle in an
                    area where it is prohibited at any time. This can include
                    areas such as fire lanes, bus stops, or areas marked with

                    Parking/standing prohibited anytime is a common violation in
                    Ward 44 because there are many areas where parking and
                    standing are prohibited due to safety and traffic flow
                    concerns. Additionally, the ward is home to popular
                    attractions like Wrigley Field, which increases traffic and
                    parking congestion in the area. The ward also has a high
                    population density, which means more vehicles are vying for
                    limited parking spots, leading to an increased likelihood of
                    parking in restricted areas.

                  <p class="font-weight-medium m-0">
                    This violation is common in Ward 44 because it is a heavily
                    populated and urban area with limited parking availability.
                    The ward also contains several popular tourist attractions
                    and entertainment venues, such as Wrigley Field stadium and
                    the Lakefront Trail, which attracts a lot of visitors and
                    causes increased traffic congestion. Additionally, the ward
                    is located in a high traffic area near downtown Chicago,
                    where parking regulations are strictly enforced. All these
                    factors contribute to a high number of expired meter
                    violations in Ward 44.

                    Residential permit parking is a parking violation where a
                    driver parks in a designated residential permit parking zone
                    without a valid permit. These zones are usually established
                    in residential areas where parking is limited due to high
                    demand.

                  </h5>
                  <p class="font-weight-medium m-0">
                    This violation is common in Ward 44 because it is a
                    residential area with limited street parking available. Many
                    residents of the ward have obtained residential parking
                    permits that allow them to park on certain streets during
                    designated hours. Non-permit holders who park in these areas
                    during restricted times may receive a ticket for violating
                    the residential permit parking regulations. Additionally,
                    the ward has a high population density and many multi-unit
                    residential buildings, which further increases the demand
                    for limited street parking.
